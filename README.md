# software-hbmenu-theme
this is a custom theme I made.
# how to install
## hbmenu v1.0
I haven't tested it on v1.0, but feel free to test it, and let me know with an issue or pull request.
## hbmenu v2.0
goto config/hbmenu/themes and drop this into your folder
## hbmenu v3.0 onwards
same thing as v2.0, but feel free to rename the file, and hit minus to access the theme menu
